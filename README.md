# agda-groupoids

Groupoids in Agda with no postulates

### Description

This formalization of groupoids is developed in an enriched style
where hom sets are replaced by hom setoids and setoid respectful
morphisms are used for composition, identity, inverse, etc. This
development does not use any postulates such as "functional
extensionality" or the univalence axiom.
